**Generalized Guidelines for Artifact Evaluation and Submission**

---

**Artifact Review and Badging:**

Artifacts are evaluated based on selected criteria which correspond to specific badges:

1. **Artifacts Available:**
   - Artifacts must be publicly and permanently retrievable.
   - Valid repositories include ACM Digital Library, institutional repositories, and open commercial repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, FigShare).
   - This badge requires only the availability, not functionality or correctness.

2. **Artifacts Evaluated - Functional:**
   - Artifacts must match the paperâ€™s expectations in functionality, usability, and relevance.
   - Evaluation involves checking:
     - Documentation: Sufficient details provided for usage.
     - Consistency: Alignment with the paper.
     - Completeness: Incorporation of all key components.
     - Exercisability: Ability to run and replicate experiments.

**Appendix Inclusion:**
- Authors are encouraged to document artifacts in an optional two-page appendix in their publication, using a standard format.

**Review and Anonymity:**

- The evaluation is "single-blind": Authors are known to evaluators, but not vice versa.
- Analytics or tracking on artifact websites should be avoided during the evaluation to protect evaluator anonymity.
- Artifacts can be private; AEC cannot publicize or retain content without consent. Evaluation participation does not mandate later publication.

**Submission Process:**

- Artifacts can be submitted via the designated evaluation site for the conference.
- A complete artifact package must include the paper, the artifact, and a README or documentation guide.

**Packaging Suggestions:**

- **Source Code:** Suitable for artifacts with minimal dependencies, easily installable.
- **Virtual Machine/Container:** Pre-configured environments using Docker or OVF files.
- **Binary Installer:** Specific platform and runtime requirements must be indicated.
- **Live Instance/Web Access:** Accessible for the evaluation duration.
- **Internet-Accessible Hardware:** VPN-access or other methods for hardware-required artifacts.
- **Screencast:** Especially useful for proprietary software/data requirements, significant computation needs, or specific hardware dependencies.

**Conflicts of Interest:**

- Defined as current or recent professional ties or collaborations within the last two years.
- Proper identification of conflicts is crucial to maintain evaluation integrity.
- AEC chairs will review declared conflicts to ensure fairness.

**Artifacts with Malicious Operations:**

- Explicit warnings in the README are compulsory for artifacts designed to perform potentially harmful operations.
- Contact AEC chairs for guidance if the artifact falls into this category.

Following these guidelines helps streamline the artifact evaluation process and ensures a consistent, fair approach to assessing the contributions associated with academic publications.
