**Generalized Guidelines for Artifact Submission**

---

**Overview:**

Research papers often involve additional components, known as artifacts, which include software, hardware, datasets, proofs, etc. These play a crucial role in validating the scientific claims. An artifact evaluation process is typically introduced to assess the quality, functionality, and reproducibility of these artifacts. This process encourages public availability, but submissions can remain private if authors prefer.

**Benefits:**

- Encourages replicability and reproducibility.
- Facilitates scientific progress by allowing others to build on previous work.
- Directly benefits authors by enhancing their work's credibility and usability.

**Goals:**

- Increase the investment in community-shared resources.
- Validate claims made in papers.
- Provide a platform for future research.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Artifacts are judged by how well they conform to the paper's expectations. Key qualities include:

- Consistency with the paper.
- Completeness and documentation.
- Ease of reuse.

**Badges:**

Badges are awarded based on specific criteria:

1. **Artifacts Available:** Artifacts must be retrievable publicly and permanently, using recognized repositories like Zenodo.
   
2. **Artifacts Evaluated:** Artifacts should meet expectations for functionality, usability, and relevance. Two levels exist within this badge:
   - **Functional:** Meets basic standards.
   - **Reusable:** Exceeds standards, facilitating broader use.

3. **Results Reproduced:** Artifacts can independently support the paper's main results under allowed tolerances.

**Process:**

- Artifacts are submitted after paper acceptance, across several review cycles.
- Authors are encouraged to prepare artifacts while awaiting acceptance to manage short timelines.

**Packaging Artifacts:**

An effective package contains:

- The final version of the paper.
- The artifact.
- Comprehensive instructions and README for evaluators.

**Submission Format Suggestions:**

- Source Code: For simple installations across systems.
- Containers/VMs: Pre-setup environments like Docker.
- Cloud Environments: Platforms like CloudLab or Chameleon.
- Binary Installers: Clear specification of requirements.
- Live Instances: Web hosting for evaluation duration.
- Access for Specialized Hardware: Provision of internet or SSH access if needed.

**Anonymity & Confidentiality:**

- Artifact evaluation is single-blind; authors' identities are known, but not the evaluators.
- Evaluators may not retain or publicize any part of the artifacts.

**Submission Steps:**

1. **Registration:** Submit abstract and PDF of accepted paper.
2. **Submission:** Upload archive or provide URL, ensuring it meets badge criteria.

**Further Recommendations:**

- Use Zenodo for artifact hosting.
- Detailed screencasts and proper documentation help evaluators understand and utilize artifacts.
- Avoid embedding analytics or tracking on artifact websites during review.

**Helpful Resources:**

- Online tips and HOWTOs for artifact preparation are available to assist in effective submissions.

By adhering to these generalized guidelines, authors can ensure their artifacts are well-packaged and evaluated effectively, enhancing the impact and credibility of their research work.
