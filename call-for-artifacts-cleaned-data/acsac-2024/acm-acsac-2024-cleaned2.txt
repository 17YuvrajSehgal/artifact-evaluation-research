**Generalized Guidelines for Security Research Artifact Evaluation**

---

**Rationale:**

Security research often suffers from poor reproducibility due to the lack of released software and datasets. This hinders fair comparisons among different solutions and burdens researchers with re-implementation tasks. Encouraging the release and public accessibility of software and data artifacts addresses these issues, promoting reproducibility and real-world deployment of security solutions.

**Participation Incentives:**

- Authors participating in the artifact evaluation are recognized with a special mention at the conference and on the official website, as well as an IEEE Xplorer badge on their papers.

**Artifacts Submission and Registration:**

1. **Artifacts Registration:**
   - Submit the paper title and a brief description of the intended artifacts (software and/or data), specifying where they were utilized in the paper.
   - For software, include details on source code/binaries and execution requirements.
   - For data, provide information on size, format, and schema.

2. **Artifacts Submission:**
   - By the deadline, submit the paper PDF, code repository URL (e.g., GitHub), and a data repository link if applicable.
   - Check the "ready for review" box for consideration.

3. **Preparation Recommendations:**
   - Use a single repository or stable webpage for artifact downloads and documentation.
   - Provide detailed documentation beyond paper contents, referencing specific sections or data as needed.
   - Employ Docker containers or VirtualBox images for smooth compilation/execution to avoid dependency issues.
   - Ensure documentation supports execution outside of provided environments.
   - Arrange remote access to custom systems or infrastructure if necessary.
   - Include execution time estimates and environment descriptions for resource-intensive artifacts.

**Artifacts Evaluation Process:**

Artifacts will be evaluated based on IEEE guidelines for badges:

1. **Documented:** An artifact inventory and description must enable exercise by reviewers.
2. **Consistent:** Artifacts should inherently contribute to the paper's results.
3. **Complete:** Artifacts should, as much as possible, include necessary components (Proxies for proprietary data can be used to demonstrate analysis).
4. **Exercisable:** Scripts/software should generate paper results; data must be accessible and manipulable.

- The evaluation is interactive, allowing authors to receive feedback and adjust submissions accordingly.
- A "kick the tires" period precedes full evaluation to ensure readiness.
- Mid-eval feedback helps optimize the artifact for successful badge acquisition.

**Final Papers Preparation:**

- Final papers must incorporate the IEEE Xplorer Artifact badge if earned, with specific instructions provided post-evaluation decision.

Adherence to these guidelines fosters improved reproducibility and integrity within the security research community, enhancing collaborative progress and innovation.
