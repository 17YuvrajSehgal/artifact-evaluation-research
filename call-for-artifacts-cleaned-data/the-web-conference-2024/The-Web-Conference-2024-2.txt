**Generalized Guidelines for Artifact Submission for The Web Conference**

---

**Purpose:**

The Web Conference encourages authors of accepted papers to apply for the "Artifacts Available" badge, promoting the sharing and reuse of research artifacts such as datasets, machine learning models, and software components. This initiative aims to enhance transparency and collaboration within the research community.

**Scope:**

Eligible submissions include artifacts used or generated by accepted papers in all tracks of the main and companion proceedings, excluding workshop papers.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Eligibility:**
   - The program is open to authors of accepted papers from The Web Conference.
   - Artifacts can include new datasets, code, or similar contributions linked to the paper.

2. **Requirements:**
   - Artifacts must be hosted in a publicly accessible, archival research repository.
   - The repository must assign a unique dereferenceable identifier, such as a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).
   - Recommended repositories offering DOIs include Zenodo, Kaggle, Figshare, and DataDryad.

3. **Application Process:**
   - Authors of accepted papers will receive a submission link to apply for the badge.

**Review Process:**

- A volunteer-based review committee will confirm that artifacts are indeed stored in the specified archival repository and are publicly accessible.
- This review is lighter compared to typical artifact evaluations since the focus is on the availability and accessibility of artifacts rather than their functionality or correctness.

By following these guidelines, authors can share their research artifacts effectively, boosting their work's impact and fostering a collaborative research environment.
