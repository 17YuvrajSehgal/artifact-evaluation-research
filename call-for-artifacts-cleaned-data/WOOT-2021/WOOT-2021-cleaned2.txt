**Generalized Submission Guidelines for Artifact Evaluation**

**Submission Requirements:**
1. **Abstract Details:** Provide a PDF with an abstract detailing the core idea, focus, and evaluation objectives of your artifact.
2. **Accepted Paper Version:** Include a PDF of the most recent version of your conditionally accepted paper.
3. **Documentation:** Supply comprehensive documentation to reproduce the contributions of your paper.
4. **Artifact Access:** Share a link to your artifact that is accessible anonymously.

**Submission Conditions:**
- Submit artifacts via the designated email, avoiding direct attachments of binary programs. Instead, provide links where necessary.
- Artifacts can include software, hardware, datasets, documentation, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, etc.
- Note that paper proofs are not accepted in the evaluation process.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Artifacts are assessed on:
- **Consistency:** Alignment with the paper.
- **Completeness:** Thoroughness of the provided components.
- **Documentation:** Clarity and effectiveness of documentation.
- **Reusability:** Ease of reuse for facilitating further research.

**Evaluation Process:**
- Artifact evaluation is independent of paper reviews and occurs post-acceptance.
- At least one evaluation committee member will review each artifact.
- Reviewers may contact authors to resolve issues while maintaining anonymity.
- Successful evaluations result in a dedicated badge on the camera-ready paper.

**Confidentiality and Permission:**
- Committee members cannot publicize or retain any part of the artifact.
- Participation in the evaluation does not obligate authors to make artifacts public, though it is encouraged.

**Special Considerations:**
- Artifacts designed for malicious operations must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation for safety.
- Authors can discuss additional considerations (e.g., evaluating specific tools).

**Benefits of Artifact Submission:**
- Enhances science and engineering reproducibility.
- Fosters community development by enabling further research and collaboration.
- Provides recognition, contributing to higher impact research publications.

**Contact:**
- Reach out for queries or concerns, especially for artifacts requiring special handling, like bug-finding tools or other specialized requirements.
